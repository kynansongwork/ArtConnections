# ArtConnections

Art Connections is a basic project to solidify my knowledge using apis and the MVVM-C architecture pattern.

It will be designed to function as a basic social media application.

Stage 1:
* Set up the basic coordinator pattern.
* Enable user profile creation.
* Creating seperate branches to explore the different methods of using Firebase or Cognito.
* Completing sign-up, log-in and retrieving user detail functionality.

Stage 2:
* Add tab bar controls.
* Add settings page and logout.
* Set up profile to persist once logged on.
* Instagram intergration in collection view.


## Notes
* Using -https://github.com/StewThom/MVVM-C-Demo-App- to set up basic navigation architecture
